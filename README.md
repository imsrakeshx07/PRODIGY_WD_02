# STOP WATCH APPLICATION

Exciting News!

I'm thrilled to share my latest project with you - a web-based stopwatch application that showcases my skills in front-end development and user experience design.

As a detail-oriented and innovative developer, I designed this application to help individuals boost their productivity and stay focused on their goals. With features like lap tracking, reset, and pause functions, this tool is perfect for anyone looking to optimize their workflow and achieve more in less time.

What sets this project apart:

Clean and intuitive design that prioritizes user experience Efficient coding that ensures seamless functionality Responsive design that adapts to various devices and screen sizes

I'm proud to have built this application from scratch, leveraging my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a high-quality and user-friendly tool.

Take a look at the application and see how it can help you stay on track and achieve your goals! https://imsrakeshx07.github.io/PRODIGY_WD_02/
